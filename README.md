# Tic Tac Toe Game (Java)

This repository contains a simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using Java. The game allows two players to take turns marking X and O on a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive command-line interface.
- Error handling to prevent invalid moves.
- Automatic detection of game outcomes (win, draw, or ongoing).
- Supports two players, alternating turns.
- The game ends when a player wins or the board is filled with no winner.

## Game Rules

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Player 1 uses 'X' and player 2 uses 'O'.
3. Players take turns entering their moves by specifying the box number (1 to 9) they want to mark.
4. A player wins if they have three marks (X or O) in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line.
5. If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
